    "Today we will see how to work with such syntax and have a first look to how the report template should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use R Markdown?\n",
    "1. **Reproducibility:** Easily reproduce analyses and reports.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility:** Create reports in various formats (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.).\n",
    "3. **Efficiency:** Combine code and text seamlessly.\n",
    "4. **Interactivity:** Incorporate interactive elements like plots and tables.\n",

    "### Aesthetic matters\n",
    "Tidy and organised markdowns are easier to read for you and who you share them with.\n",
    "It is always great to properly document your work and divide it into meaningful sections.\n",
