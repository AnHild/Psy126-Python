    "By adding `{.tabset}` to the first title in the Markdown we create a tabular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially handy if we want to separate our descriptive statistics (data exploration, etc.), from our analysis pipeline or results.\n",

    "Important reminders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `#` Heading will only be used once at the top with the command `{.tabset}` to create a tabular structure\n",
    "- `##` Headings creates new `tabset` -> as a rule of tumb, keep these to a maximum of 4.\n",
    "- `###` and `####` Headings can be used to create titles within a tabset, as you see them used in this Markdown.\n",

    "### What is R Markdown?\n",
    "R Markdown is an open-source tool that integrates R programming with Markdown syntax to create dynamic documents that combine code, results, and narrative text.\n",
    "Today we will see how to work with such syntax and have a first look to how the report template should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use R Markdown?\n",
    "1. **Reproducibility:** Easily reproduce analyses and reports.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility:** Create reports in various formats (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.).\n",
    "3. **Efficiency:** Combine code and text seamlessly.\n",
    "4. **Interactivity:** Incorporate interactive elements like plots and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a New R Markdown Document\n",
    "1. Open RStudio.\n",
    "2. Click on \"File\" > \"New File\" > \"R Markdown\".\n",
    "3. Choose the document format (e.g., HTML, PDF, Word).\n",
    "4. Give your document a title and author name.\n",
    "5. Click \"OK\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of an R Markdown Document\n",
    "- **YAML Header:** Contains metadata like title, author, and output format.\n",
    "- **Markdown Syntax:** Used for formatting text.\n",
    "- **Code Chunks:** Contains R code enclosed in (\\```) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Aesthetic matters\n",
    "Tidy and organised markdowns are easier to read for you and who you share them with.\n",
    "It is always great to properly document your work and divide it into meaningful sections.\n",
    "This will be especially true when working with your future supervisors on your practical project, but more on that later on.\n",

    "## Formatting Text in R Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Markdown\n",
    "This Markdown has a tabular structure. It is great to use for longer projects that are easily compartmentalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is suitable for longer analysis, as we can better structure our markdown to make it more easily readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, with this format it will not be possible to\n",
    "\n",
    "Some example of how to format our text will follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Headers\n",
    "Use hashtags `##` to create tabsets. The number of hashtags indicates the level of the header (e.g., # Header 1, ## Header 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emphasis\n",
    "- *Italic*: Surround text with single asterisks `*` or underscores `_`.\n",
    "- **Bold**: Surround text with double asterisks `**` or underscores `__`.\n",
    "- ***Bold Italic***: Combine both formats with triple asterisks `***` or underscores ``___``.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "1. **Ordered List:** Use numbers followed by a period.\n",
    "2. **Unordered List:** Use dashes, asterisks, or plus signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indenting is also possible by inserting a `tab-space`\n",
    "  - As long as you remember to put a space between the symbol and the written text\n",
    "\n",
    "### Links\n",
    "- **Inline Links:** Surround link text with square brackets [  ] and the link URL with parentheses (  ).\n",
    "  - Here is an example: [Serious Rmarkdown](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Ficdv9tg5eyt61.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dabe6d1e9bf13f245626b3cf21b4b45e866abcd8b)\n",
    "- **Reference Links:** Define the link URL at the bottom of the document using square brackets [  ] and a colon (:), followed by the URL in parentheses (  ).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images\n",
    "- **Inline Images:** Similar syntax to inline links, but with an exclamation mark (!) before the square brackets.\n",
    "- **Reference Images:** Define image URLs at the bottom of the document using square brackets [] and a colon (:), followed by the URL in parentheses ().\n",
    "- We will not be using this function in our markdown, but rather we will be coding and displaying plots. Lets jump to an example of how we can do exactly that.\n",
